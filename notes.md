# Notes setting this all up
- Retrieve your OpenAI key 
```platform.openai.com/api-keys```
- Create a .env file and store your key there
    - MAKE SURE .env is in your .gitignore file
    - !!! BE CAUTIOUS OF THIS AND MAYBE DO A TEST RUN FIRST IF YOU PLAN ON PUSHING THIS TO GIT!
- Activate your virtual environment
- ```pip install openai```
    - check that it is > 1 
    - ```pip install --upgrade openai```
- Install dot env to pull the api key ```pip install python-dotenv```
